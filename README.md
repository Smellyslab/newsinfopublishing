# newsinfopublishing
attempt at writing a user based news publishing system for un-biased news.

#__intended purposes__
- intended to be used for information sharing
- intended to be used for un-biased media and news controlled by people for people
- intended to be userfriendly

#__todos__
- create homepage // 
- create usersystem and login // not to be done as it defeats being anonymous...  
- create API interface // 
- setup some sort of payment system for things like memberships etc // again would require a user system. 
- eventually attemp other things like crypto wallets for user based payments, etc.... // maybe, would need a user system but i could use web3 // would also be restricted to certain cryptos as other arent that anonymous.
